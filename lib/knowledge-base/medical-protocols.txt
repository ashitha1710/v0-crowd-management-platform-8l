# Medical Protocols for Crowded Events

## Emergency Medical Response Procedures

### Immediate Actions for Medical Emergencies
1. Assess the situation for safety risks
2. Activate emergency medical alert system immediately
3. Designate someone to call emergency services (dial 911)
4. Provide basic first aid if trained and safe to do so
5. Secure the area to maintain crowd control

### Cardiac Arrest Protocol
- Start CPR immediately if trained
- Use AED (Automated External Defibrillator) if available
- Continue CPR until medical professionals arrive
- Do not leave patient unattended

### Heat Exhaustion Management
Symptoms: Excessive sweating, dizziness, weakness, nausea
Treatment:
- Move person to cool, shaded area
- Remove excess clothing
- Provide cool water to drink slowly
- Apply cool, wet cloths to skin
- Seek medical attention if symptoms worsen

### Crowd Crush Management
Immediate Actions:
- Guide crowd to open exits to relieve pressure
- Prevent forward surge
- Assist fallen individuals
- Coordinate with security for controlled evacuation
- Medical personnel to assess for crush injuries (internal bleeding, organ damage)

### Traumatic Injuries
- Spinal injuries: Keep person still, do not move unless necessary
- Severe bleeding: Apply direct pressure with clean cloth
- Fractures: Immobilize injured area, apply ice if possible
- Burns: Cool with water, cover with clean cloth, prevent contamination

### Mental Health Crises
- De-escalate situation calmly
- Remove from stressful environment if possible
- Listen without judgment
- Summon mental health professionals if available
- Prevent self-harm or harm to others

### Severe Allergic Reaction (Anaphylaxis) Protocol
Symptoms:
- Sudden difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing
- Swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat
- Hives, itching, or rash
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
- Dizziness, confusion, or loss of consciousness
- Rapid or weak pulse
- Pale or bluish skin

Immediate Actions:
1. Call emergency services (dial 911) immediately
2. Help person lie down and elevate legs if experiencing shock
3. If trained and available: Administer epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) in outer thigh
4. Loosen tight clothing and maintain airway
5. DO NOT give anything by mouth if person is having difficulty breathing
6. Monitor breathing and pulse continuously
7. If trained: Provide CPR if no breathing or pulse
8. Transport to emergency room immediately once symptoms improve

Emergency Equipment Required:
- Epinephrine auto-injectors (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, Adrenaclick)
- Oxygen delivery equipment if available
- Blood pressure monitoring
- IV access equipment for medical professionals

Common Triggers in Event Settings:
- Food allergies (peanuts, shellfish, dairy, eggs)
- Insect stings (bees, wasps, hornets)
- Medications
- Latex exposure
- Exercise-induced anaphylaxis

Prevention and Preparedness:
- Staff training on epinephrine administration
- Location of epinephrine kits throughout venue
- Medical alert system alerts for known allergies
- Crowd control measures during high-risk activities

## Medical Equipment Checklist
- First aid kits at all medical stations
- Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs)
- Oxygen tanks and masks
- Blood pressure monitors
- Glucose testing kits
- Spinal immobilization equipment
- Emergency stretchers

## Communication Protocols
- Use walkie-talkies for medical team coordination
- Maintain clear radio channels for emergency calls
- Establish emergency codes:
  - Code Blue: Cardiac arrest
  - Code Red: Fire emergency
  - Code White: Severe weather evacuation
  - Code Black: Crowd crush incident

## Post-Incident Procedures
- Document all medical interventions
- Provide incident reports for regulatory compliance
- Review event with medical team for lessons learned
