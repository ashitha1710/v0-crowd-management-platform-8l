# Gate Management Guidelines and FAQs

## General Gate Operation Policies

### Timing Guidelines
- Gates open 30 minutes before scheduled event start time
- Gates close when venue reaches maximum capacity OR 2 hours after event start (whichever comes first)
- Emergency gates can be opened during operation only for legitimate emergencies
- VIP/artist entrance gates have flexible timing per artist rider requirements

### Capacity Management
- Each gate has maximum throughput rate: 1000 people per hour
- Monitor gate queues longer than 15 minutes
- Implement crowd management barriers when needed
- Never allow gate capacity to exceed 80% of maximum throughput

### Security Protocols
- Conduct random security screenings (5-10% of attendees)
- Prohibited items: weapons, explosives, large bags, alcohol containers
- Metal detectors at all main entrances
- Security personnel stationed at each gate: minimum 2 per gate
- Crowd control teams on standby for high-volume periods

## Decision Framework: Should I Open This Gate?

### Emergency Situations (ALWAYS OPEN)
- Fire evacuation required
- Medical emergency requiring immediate access
- Security threat requiring emergency exit
- Weather emergency (tornado, severe storm)
- Bomb threat or active shooter situation

### Crowd Management Decisions (CONDITIONALLY OPEN)
YES - Open Additional Gates When:
- Primary gate queues exceed 20 minutes
- Crowd density near gate reaches 90% capacity
- VIP/Elderly/Disabled lines form (priority access)
- Temperature extremes require faster entry
- Event schedule changes requiring rapid crowd movement
- Mall/hotel lobbies backing up with audiences

NO - Keep Gates Closed When:
- Opening would create unsafe crowd flow
- Target zone capacity already exceeded
- Opening would block emergency vehicle access
- Security concerns with external crowds
- Traffic congestion would prevent safe dispersal

### Staff Shortage Considerations
- Minimum 2 security per gate must be maintained
- Coordinate with supervisor before opening emergency gates
- Consider bottleneck effects on other gates
- Ensure proper crowd control barriers are in place
- Monitor for pickpocketing/black market activity increases

## Crowd Flow Management

### Queuing Best Practices
- Implement serpentine queue patterns for capacity

### Surge Control Measures
- Staggered gate opening times
- Crowd control barriers (stanchions)
- Trained "queuing guides" for organization
- Audio announcements to manage expectations
- Security monitoring for queue-jumping

### Bottleneck Prevention
- Monitor density levels at chokepoints
- Deploy additional security during peak times
- Consider temporary gate additions for concerts
- Analyze historical data for pattern prediction

## Communication Protocols

### Gate Status Reporting
- Report queue lengths every 10 minutes during peak times
- Alert command center of security concerns immediately
- Notify event producer of capacity issues
- Coordinate with transportation authorities if needed

### Emergency Codes
- Code Orange: Crowd surge approaching

- Code Purple: Security threat detected
- Code Black: Evacuation procedure initiated

### Radio Communication
- Channel assignments per gate team
- Regular check-ins with command post
- Cross-gate coordination for load balancing
- Emergency backup frequencies available
